<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Fluently is a web application that connects people who want to practice a language they are learning locally. Users can sign up on the app, search for other users who speak the language they want to practice and are willing to meet up in person to practice together. The app also provides an instant messaging feature so users can communicate and plan the details of their meetup. With Fluently, users can improve their language skills and meet other people interested in learning and practicing languages.
